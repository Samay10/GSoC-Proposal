# Comprehensive Gemma Model Benchmarking Suite
## Google Summer of Code 2025 Proposal

### 1. Project Overview

#### Objective
Develop an advanced, automated benchmarking framework for comprehensive evaluation of Google's Gemma language models, focusing on:
- Systematic performance assessment across multiple benchmarks
- Innovative custom benchmark development
- Reproducible and extensible evaluation methodology

### 2. Problem Statement

Benchmark Gemma Models: Develop a comprehensive benchmark suite to test Gemma models on a range of tasks and datasets (academic benchmarks like MMLU, GSM8K, etc., and custom datasets).
- Create scripts for automation. Automate the benchmarking process for various tasks.
- Compare performance of various Gemma model families. Run the benchmarks on different Gemma model sizes and variants.
- Compare performance against other open models. Include other popular open models (e.g., Llama 2, Mistral) in the benchmark for comparison.
- Create informative summaries of benchmark results. Generate reports and visualizations summarizing the results. This should include tables, charts, and potentially a leaderboard.
- Regular Updates: Design the benchmark to be easily updated with new Gemma models and datasets.
- Reproducibility: Provide clear instructions and scripts to allow others to reproduce the benchmark results.

#### Project Scope
- **Complexity:** Medium to High. Requires an understanding of benchmarking methodologies, machine learning evaluation, and scripting.
- **Expected Size:** 175-350 hours.

### 3. Proposed Solution: Comprehensive Benchmarking Suite
As a solution to the challenges in evaluating open source language models, my proposal is to build a robust benchmarking suite that provides a standardized, automated, and reproducible evaluation framework for Gemma models. This solution will include automated benchmarking scripts, comparisons across different model variants and competing open models, and the generation of detailed performance summaries with visualizations. It will be well designed for easy updates with new models and datasets ensuring that it can be used for testing the future versions of the models too.
